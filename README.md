# Web Scrapping Crypto Data

### This is my first web-scraping project using bs4(BeautifulSoup).
### I use requests module, to send an API request to https://coinmarketcap.com/ and grab some information (currencyName, price, volume(24h)) from it and make a sqlite database.

### At first, run the file "main.py".  then two files will be created. the first one is a sqlite3 database and the second file is "display.py" which uses tkinter and ttk to display the database in a graphical table.
